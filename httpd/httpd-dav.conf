# Distributed authoring and versioning (WebDAV)

# Required modules: mod_alias, mod_auth_digest, mod_authn_core, mod_authn_file,
#                   mod_authz_core, mod_authz_user, mod_dav, mod_dav_fs,
#                   mod_setenvif

# The following example gives DAV write access to a directory called
# "uploads" under the ServerRoot directory.
#
# The User/Group specified in httpd.conf needs to have write permissions
# on the directory where the DavLockDB is placed and on any directory where
# "Dav On" is specified.

DavLockDB "/usr/local/apache2/DavLock"

<Directory "/usr/local/apache2/htdocs">
    Dav On

    # Disable lookup of index.html when path has trailing slash.

    # You can use the htdigest program to create the password database:
    #   htpasswd -c "/usr/local/apache2/users.passwd" admin

    AuthName WebDAV

    # Use the DavDepthInfinity directive to allow the processing of PROPFIND
    # requests containing the header 'Depth: Infinity'. Because this type of
    # request could constitute a denial-of-service attack, by default it is not
    # allowed.

# The following directives disable redirects on non-GET requests for
# a directory that does not include the trailing slash.  This fixes a 
# problem with several clients that do not appropriately handle 
# redirects for folders with DAV methods.
